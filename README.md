# Transfer_Learning_Dog_Breeds


Dog Breed Classifier with transfer learning
In this project I will use keras and a dataset of 6700 labeled dog breed images to create a dog breed classifier. I will be using the VGG16 ImageNet model without the last layer as a base, then I will add a new fully connected layer that will output a vector that holds the predicted dog breed.

I downloaded the dataset of dog images from this repository:https://github.com/udacity/dog-project
